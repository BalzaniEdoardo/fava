#

# cancellation passes trivially.
#
# Where the worker is forked, patching VideoHandler *before* the reader is
# constructed means the child inherits the slowed method. Nothing in ``src`` is
# touched, and the parent is unaffected because only the worker decodes.
#
# This depends on fork copying the parent's memory. Under spawn (Windows) the
# child re-imports the package, so the patch never reaches it and the worker runs
# at full speed. These tests are skipped there rather than left to pass for the
# wrong reason: the parent cancels a superseded future synchronously, so the
# cancellation assertions would still hold with no lag at all, and whether the
# first request was still in flight would come down to timing.
