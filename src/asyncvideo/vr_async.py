class AsyncVideoReader:
    """
    Video reader that decodes in a separate process.

    Requesting a frame returns a `concurrent.futures.Future` immediately, and the
    decode happens in a worker process, so the calling thread is never blocked by
    it. Each reader owns one process, so several readers decode genuinely in
    parallel — which is the point when displaying more than one video at a time.

    Frames come back in the video's native pixel format, one per request. Use
    `to_rgb` to convert them for display.

    A new request supersedes any older one still in flight: the earlier future is
    cancelled rather than queued. Indexing on every change of a slider therefore
    stays responsive instead of working through frames that are no longer wanted.

    Parameters
    ----------
    path :
        Path to the video file.
    time :
        Timestamps for each frame, in seconds. Pass this when frame times come
        from an acquisition system rather than a constant frame rate; `get` and
        `t` then use this clock. If ``None``, a uniform grid is derived from the
        stream's average rate.
    yuv_packed :
        For a ``yuv420p`` video, transfer the frame as a single packed
        ``(1, H * 3 // 2, W)`` array rather than as a ``(Y, U, V)`` tuple of
        planes. Ignored for ``rgb24`` video.
    stream_index :
        Index of the video stream to read, for files carrying more than one.
    buffer_size :
        Number of recently decoded frames the worker keeps cached. A request that
        hits the cache needs no seeking or decoding. Default is 30.

    Notes
    -----
    - The reader owns a process, so call `shutdown` when finished with it.
    - There is no ``pixel_format`` parameter, unlike `VideoHandler`: frames are
      always decoded in the video's native format. Use `to_rgb` to convert them.

    >>> reader = AsyncVideoReader("example.mp4")  # doctest: +SKIP
