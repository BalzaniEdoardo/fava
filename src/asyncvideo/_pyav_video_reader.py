class VideoHandler(BaseAudioVideo):
    """
    Random-access video reader with timestamp-aware seeking.

    This class wraps a PyAV container to provide precise, timestamp-based
    random access to frames. It can return either `av.VideoFrame` objects
    or RGB float arrays in the shape ``(H, W, 3)`` normalized to ``[0, 1]``.
    Internally, a background thread builds an index of presentation timestamps
    (PTS) for fast seeks, with a fallback to on-the-fly indexing when the total
    frame count is unknown.

    Parameters
    ----------
    video_path :
        Path to the video file.
    stream_index :
        Index of the video stream to use, default is 0.
    time :
        Experimental timestamps for each frame (seconds). If ``None``, a
        uniform grid is generated from the stream's average rate.
    pixel_format :
        PyAV pixel format string for decoded frames. Supported values are
        ``"rgb24"``, ``"yuv420p"`` and ``"yuv444p"``. The default is ``None``,
        which skips conversion and returns raw `av.VideoFrame` instances; pass
        an explicit format to get numpy arrays instead.
    buffer_size :
        Number of recently decoded frames to keep in the FIFO frame buffer.
        On a cache hit the frame is returned without any seeking or decoding.
        Default is 30 (roughly 1 s at 30 fps).

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from asyncvideo import VideoHandler
    >>> # Pass a pixel_format to get numpy arrays; the default returns
    >>> # raw av.VideoFrame objects instead.
    >>> vh = VideoHandler("example.mp4", pixel_format="rgb24")  # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> # Shape: (n_frames, height, width, channels)
    >>> vh.shape  # doctest: +SKIP
    (100, 480, 640, 3)
    >>> # Get the frame at 1.5 seconds.
    >>> frame = vh.get(1.5)  # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> # Shape: (height, width, channels)
    >>> frame.shape  # doctest: +SKIP
    (480, 640, 3)
    >>> # Get frames from the second to the 10th, every other frame.

        - The "Presentation Time Stamp" to each keyframe.

        - If a ``time`` array was given at initialization, that array is

          timestamps, so they are the real frame times rather than a uniform grid
          derived from the nominal frame rate -- which matters for variable frame
          rate video, and for recordings that drop frames.
        - These are absolute times on the container's clock, so the first frame is
          not necessarily at ``0``. Subtract ``time[0]`` for times relative to the
          start of the video.
        - Reading this blocks until the background indexer has seen every frame,
          since a frame's timestamp is not known before then. Indexing a video by
